												Logitech collects and uses various types of personal information when
												you
												use its products and services, which are described within the Logitech
												Product and Web Privacy Policies.</p>
											<p>Logitech shares personal data with third parties for business purposes.
												Specifically, here are the seven categories of activities for which we
												share
												data for business purposes:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Auditing</li>
												<li>Security</li>
												<li>Debugging and Technical Troubleshooting</li>
												<li>Short term, transient use (personal information is not disclosed to
													third parties and it is not used to build profiles)</li>
												<li>Performing Services</li>
												<li>Internal Research</li>
												<li>Testing or Product/Service Improvement</li>
											</ul>
											<p>If you are a resident of California, you have the right to request to
												know
												what personal information has been collected about you, how we use,
												share
												and disclose it, and to access that information. You also have the right
												to
												request that we delete your personal information, though exceptions
												under
												the CCPA may allow us to retain and use certain personal information.
											</p>
											<p>We do not sell your personal information. In limited circumstances we
												share
												your personal information for advertising. You can “opt-out” of having
												your
												personal information used for this purpose by contacting us at <a
													href="https://support.logitech.com/response-center">support.logitech.com/response-center</a>.
											</p>
											<p>You can learn more about how to submit a data rights request through
												contact
												details located within this policy. You may also send your request by
												email
												to <a href="mailto:privacy@logitech.com">privacy@logitech.com</a> or
												call
												our toll-free number +1 800 711 8156. An agent may submit a request on
												your
												behalf, but you must provide proof that the agent is authorized to do so
												by
												providing the agent with a signed letter giving permission to submit a
												request on your behalf and you must confirm that authorization directly
												with
												us by sending an email to <a
													href="mailto:privacy@logitech.com">privacy@logitech.com</a>.</p>
											<p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the
												CCPA. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not deny you goods or
												services,
												charge different prices or rates, or provide a different service level
												for
												exercising your privacy rights. However, we may offer certain financial
												incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices,
												discounts or quality levels. Any incentive we offer will reasonably
												relate
												to your personal information and will only be collected or processed
												with
												your consent.</p>
											<h2 class="h5">California’s Shine the Light Law</h2>
											<p>Separate from the CCPA, California’s Shine the Light law gives California
												residents the right to ask companies what personal information they
												share
												with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
												We do
												not disclose your personal information to third parties for the purpose
												of
												directly marketing their goods or services to you unless you request it.

												<h2 class="h5">Software Updates</h2>
												<p>Our servers automatically record certain information, including the
													IP
													address, the software version, and the connected devices to check
													for
													necessary software updates and download the required device images
													or
													assets, during and after the installation of our software.</p>
												<h2 class="h5">Performance, Diagnostics and Analytics</h2>
												<p>With your consent, some of our software (like Logitech Options,
													Capture,
													Presentation app, Setpoint, and Logitech Control Center) collect and
													record information about the software, devices, and other
													information
													such as:</p>
												<ul>
													<li>usage of software features;</li>
													<li>customization of your devices;</li>
													<li>system hardware and software like OS version;</li>
													<li>city-level location information using IP address;</li>
													<li>device usage frequency like click, and button count. For
														example, so
														that we can analyze the durability and dependability of our
														products, we may capture how many times each button is used
														during
														the course of 24 hours;</li>
													<li>Logitech Capture-specific information – we capture scene usage
														and
														camera model information. We do not analyze or transmit audio or
														video from the user.</li>
													<li>Logitech Presenters capture when you start and end a
														presentation,
														along with the application name and version you are using. We
														collect this information so that we can help improve
														functionality.
													</li>
												</ul>
												<p>We do not collect the data you insert while using your mice,
													keyboards or
													touchpads. A Keystroke assignment refers to when you customize your
													device and assign a shortcut, our apps require permission from you
													in
													order to perform the assigned shortcut. </p>
												<h2 class="h5">Product Functionality</h2>
												<p>We sometimes collect data like device and application information for
													product features to function properly. For example, Logitech Flow is
													a
													feature in some devices that allows you to seamlessly switch between
													two
													or three computers, and transfer text, images, and files from one
													computer to another. To enable automatic discovery of computers
													during
													the setup process of Flow, we may collect your device identifier and
													IP

											<h2 class="h5">Activation and Registration</h2>
											<p>To activate and register your products, you provide information to us to
												create an account, including your name, email address, password, credit
												card
												(if you subscribe to premium services), camera name, and camera
												settings.
											</p>
											<p>We also offer activation and registration through third party open
												authorization (OAuth2) services, such as Facebook, so you can share
												clips
												you’ve selected to that service.</p>
											<p>While setting up the product, the country code of operation needs to be
												set.
												Some operating systems may prompt for location data access when
												determining
												the country code of operation.</p>
											<h2 class="h5">Circle Video and Audio Recordings</h2>
											<p>When you use Circle products and services, our servers automatically
												receive,
												record, and process data necessary to provide the service as well as
												information from the devices you use to view or listen to the data,
												including:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>video and audio recordings;</li>
												<li>device-specific information like hardware model, operating system
													version, and device identifiers such as MAC address, mobile network
													information, router names and meta-data concerning Apple Home Hubs
													and
													other Apple HomeKit devices;</li>
												<li>service event logging information;</li>
												<li>time and date of service use;</li>
												<li>on/off, and other interaction with the product;</li>
												<li>crashes, system activity, and hardware settings; and</li>
												<li>geo-location information (when location services are enabled)</li>
											</ul>
											<p>Circle products may send pseudonymous information to an analytics tool,
												including timestamps, transmission statistics, feature usage,
												performance
												metrics, errors, etc. We use the pseudonymous information to provide,
												enhance, and improve our services, features, technical support and
												information.</p>
											<h2 class="h5">Circle Features</h2>
											<p>Circle products have features that, if enabled, require us to collect and
												analyze data intelligently for them to work. For example, Smart Location
												automatically detects when you leave the house or come home, and Smart
												Alerts intelligently analyze motion to make sure you only get relevant
												alerts.</p>
											<h2 class="h5">Circle Security and Storage</h2>
											<p>We have implemented Circle products so that no Logitech employee,
												contractor,
												vendor, affiliate, or governmental entity can access unencrypted
												footage.
												Every Circle camera has a unique private key and digital certificate,
												which
												is used to encrypt communications in transit. The Circle servers use AES
												256
												Bit Dual Layer Encryption to store your footage encrypted-at-rest.</p>
											<p>Data collected is stored directly within the application, on your Device,
												and
												on servers in the U.S. or other countries where we or our affiliates,
												subsidiaries or service providers have facilities. We will retain
												collected
												information for as long as needed to provide the service and in
												accordance
												with the Logitech Privacy Policy.</p>
											<h2 class="h5">Circle Cameras with Apple HomeKit Support</h2>
											<p>When a Circle camera is connected to the Apple HomeKit ecosystem, Apple
												controls the data generated and passed to HomeKit and is responsible for
												the
												privacy and handling of your audio and video content. We have no ability
												or
												mechanism to access any HomeKit audio/video data.</p>
											<p>If a Circle camera is only set up in HomeKit, the camera will still
												periodically check our servers for firmware update availability. This
												involves sending the model, firmware version, and the country code of
												operation to our servers.</p>
											<p>If you enable the sharing of diagnostic information with Logitech through
												the
												Apple Home App, the following data will be shared with Logitech and/or
												Apple, and used for troubleshooting purposes only:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>device-specific information such as hardware model, names, operating
													system version, device identifiers such as MAC address, information
													about nearby wireless networks, and meta-data concerning Apple Home
													Hubs
													and other HomeKit devices;</li>
												<li>device event logging information;</li>
												<li>time and date of device use;</li>
												<li>on/off, and other interaction with the Product;</li>
												<li>crashes, system activity, hardware settings; and</li>
												<li>any additional details submitted by you such as descriptions,
													screenshots and footage.</li>

											<h2 class="h5">Ultimate Ears Mobile Functions and Customization</h2>
											<p>Users can customize their listening experience by configuring their
												devices
												using an Ultimate Ears application. These applications enable features
												like
												pairing multiple devices, tap controls, and multi-user DJ functionality.
											</p>
											<p>During the customization process, a user may be required to enter their
												name
												and contact information, including an email address and password.</p>
											<p>We do not collect any data about the content a user plays using Ultimate
												Ears
												products.</p>
											<h2 class="h5">Ultimate Ears Integration with Other Services</h2>
											<p>Some Ultimate Ears products, like our Bluetooth speakers, can integrate
												with
												third-party services like Amazon Alexa. These integrations let users
												perform
												tasks like streaming music, ordering goods and services, and asking for
												information.</p>
											<p>To enable third party services that link with your Ultimate Ears device,
												you
												may be required to register with that third party and consent to their
												terms. Once the link has been made, Ultimate Ears devices can receive
												and
												pass information directly to the third party.</p>
											<p>Ultimate Ears products do not store any user command data passed from the
												user to the third party. Only data necessary to ensure the link between
												third parties and the user’s Ultimate Ears product is retained.</p>

											<p>Ultimate Ears <a href="https://pro.ultimateears.com">Pro</a> and <a
													href="https://custom.ultimateears.com">CSX</a> offer premium custom-fit in ear
												monitors (earphones). Most Pro devices require user ear impressions,
												which
												are typically created digitally or with molds. by a third party, most
												commonly an audiologist. The CSX devices require images and impressions
												of
												the user's ear to optimize the product fit. We retain these impressions
												in
												case of loss, reordering, or reproduction, or until a user requests that
												they be discarded.</p>
